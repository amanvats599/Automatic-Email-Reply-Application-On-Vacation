# Automatic Email Replier on Vacation

This is a repository for Automatic_Email_Reply Application Developed using Node.js and Google APIs. This app is able to respond to emails sent to your Gmail mailbox while youâ€™re out on a vacation.

Features
- Node.js clusters support.
- Checks for new emails in a given Gmail ID.
- Sends replies to emails that have no prior replies.
- Adds a label to the email and moves the email to the label.
- This app checks above steps every 45 to 120 in b/w sec  random time interval. 

Libraries  

1. googleapis:This package is imported from the googleapis module and provides the necessary functionality to interact
   with various Google APIs, including the Gmail API.
2. OAuth2:The OAuth2 class from the google.auth module is used to authenticate the application and obtain an access
   token for making requests to the Gmail API. It handles token refresh and retrying requests if necessary. 

Getting Started

First Thing to do go to Google Cloud Console and set up the OAuth 2.0 authentication for
your application, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.developers.google.com) and create a new project. Provide a
   suitable name for your project and click on the "Create" button.
2. Once the project is created, click on the project name to navigate to the project dashboard.
3. In the left sidebar, click on the "Credentials" tab under the "APIs & Services" section.
4. On the Credentials page, click on the "Create credentials" button and select "OAuth client ID" from the
   dropdown menu.
5. Select the application type as "Web application" and provide a name for the OAuth 2.0 client ID.
6. In the "Authorized redirect URIs" field, enter the redirect URI where you want to receive the authorization
   code. For this code, you can use "https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground".
8. Click on the "Create" button to create the OAuth client ID. You will see a modal displaying the client ID
   and client secret. Copy the values of the client ID and client secret. and also enable gmail api 
9. Now, open the OAuth 2.0 Playground (https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground).
10. In the OAuth 2.0 Playground, click on the settings icon (gear icon) on the top right corner. In the
   "OAuth 2.0 configuration" section, enter the client ID and client secret obtained in the previous step.
11. Scroll down and find the "Step 1: Select & authorize APIs" section. In the input box, enter `https://mail.google.com`
   and select the appropriate Gmail API scope.
12. Click on the "Authorize APIs" button. It will redirect you to the Google account login page. Sign in with the
   Google account associated with the Gmail account you want to use for auto-reply.
13. After successful authorization, the OAuth 2.0 Playground will display an authorization code. Copy this code.
14. Now, click on the "Exchange authorization code for tokens" button. It will exchange the authorization code for
   a refresh token.
15. The OAuth 2.0 Playground will display the refresh token. Copy the refresh token value.
16. Now, in your code, replace the placeholder values in the `credentials.js` file with the respective values
   you obtained:
   Replace CLIENT_ID with the client ID value.
   Replace CLEINT_SECRET with the client secret value.
   Replace REDIRECT_URI with the redirect URI value.
   Replace REFRESH_TOKEN with the refresh token value.
17. Save the credentials.js file.


Areas where this code can be improved.

1. Enhancing Error Handling: The current implementation logs errors during execution but lacks a comprehensive error-handling mechanism. Implementing a more robust error-handling approach would improve the code's reliability.
2. Optimizing Code Efficiency: To handle larger email volumes more efficiently, the code can be optimized. Strategies such as algorithmic improvements or asynchronous processing could be explored to enhance overall performance.
3. Ensuring Security of Sensitive Information: It is crucial to store sensitive information, like client secrets and refresh tokens, securely. Implementing secure storage practices and avoiding hardcoding such information in the code will enhance the overall security of the application.
4. Facilitating User-Specific Configuration: To enhance flexibility, the code can be modified to allow users to provide personalized configuration options. This could include features such as customizable email filters or the ability to define unique reply messages based on user preferences.
5. Implementing Time Monitoring Using Cron Jobs: The current code employs a random interval function for generating time intervals. An improvement can be made by integrating a cron jobs package to schedule email tasks more effectively, providing a more controlled and predictable time management system.
